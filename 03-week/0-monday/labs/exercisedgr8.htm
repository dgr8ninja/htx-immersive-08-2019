    <h2>Here's what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>When you make a list, do it in this order:

            <ol>
                <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                    </ul>
